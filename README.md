shootproof-sdk
==============

This is just a wrapper for the shootproof SDK that is available at http://developer.shootproof.com/code

You will need to add this to your composer.json file.  I don't want to submit this to packagist as I believe the ShootProof guys should do that.
```json
    "repositories": [
        {
            "type": "vcs",
            "url": "https://github.com/jpirkey/shootproof-sdk"
        }
    ]
```
